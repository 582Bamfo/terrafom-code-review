# General Observations
The code provisions a VPC setup with associated resources like subnets, internet gateway, route table, ECS cluster, and an auto-scaling group for EC2 instances.

- ## Strengths
The resources are logically grouped and follow a clear sequence.
Comments are used to describe the various block 
Basic tagging is used for some resources to improve resource management .
Security group rules and CIDR blocks are defined.

- ## Weaknesses
 All resources are defined in a single file.Lack of modularization.
Hardcoded values for variables (e.g., AMI IDs, regions, instance types) reducing the code reusability.
Minimal input validation or default values for user-configurable variables.
The ingress security group rule is too open (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0).
Inconsistent or non-standard naming conventions for resource names.
No explicit use of security focused and  Terraform formatting tools or linting.

- ## Issues Observed
### 1. **Hardcoding of values**
AMI ID, region, and instance type are hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
CIDR blocks and availability zones are fixed, which limits deployment flexibility.

### 2. **Security Concerns**
The security group ingress allows all traffic (from_port=0, to_port=65535, cidr_blocks=["0.0.0.0/0"]), which is a significant security risk.
The state file will be stored locally when the code is exexuted. This will hinder collaboration

### 3. **Lack of Modularity**
All resources are on single file instead of being grouped into modules (e.g., VPC, ECS, ASG).
Hard to reuse and maintain the code in larger deployments.

### 4. **Resource Naming Conventions**
Resource names are inconsistent and non-descriptive for potential multi-environment use.

### 5. **Missing Input Validation**
No input variables are defined for reusable attributes like region, instance_type, or ami.
No validation rules for CIDR blocks, making the setup prone to user errors.

### 6. **Tags Are Inconsistent**
Only some resources include tags. Tags should be applied consistently for better cost and resource management.
